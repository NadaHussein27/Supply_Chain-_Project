# Supply Chain Data Cleaning and Dashboard Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates data cleaning and visualization for a supply chain dataset. I used SQL Server to import and clean data, Power Query to transform `Lead Time` into a time format, and Excel to build an interactive dashboard.

## Files
- `data_cleaning.sql`: SQL script for table creation and data import.
- `supply_chain_dashboard.xlsx`: Excel file with the final dashboard.
- `SupplyChainDC.csv`: Original dataset (optional).

## Steps Performed
1. Cleaned data in SQL using `BULK INSERT` and `DROP TABLE`.
2. Transformed `Lead Time` using Power Query.
3. Created a dashboard in Excel to visualize Revenue and Lead Time.

## How to Use
- Run the SQL script in SQL Server to recreate the table.
- Open the Excel file to explore the dashboard.
